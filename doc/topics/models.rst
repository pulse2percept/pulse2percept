Computational Models
====================

The :py:mod:`~pulse2percept.models` module provides a number of published
and verified computational models that can be used to predict neural responses
or visual percepts resulting from electrical stimulation.

A :py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.Model` object consists of:

*  a :py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.SpatialModel`, describing how electrical
   stimulation affects the neural tissue or elicited phosphene
   *in different spatial locations of the visual field*, and/or
*  a :py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.TemporalModel`, describing how the
   response of the neural tissue or elicited phosphene evolves *over time*.

pulse2percept provides the following computational models:

================  =========================  ===================
Reference         Model                      Type
----------------  -------------------------  -------------------
[Horsager2009]_   `Horsager2009Model`        temporal
[Horsager2009]_   `Horsager2009Temporal`     temporal
[Nanduri2012]_    `Nanduri2012Model`         spatial + temporal
[Nanduri2012]_    `Nanduri2012Spatial`       spatial
[Nanduri2012]_    `Nanduri2012Temporal`      temporal
[Beyeler2019]_    `AxonMapModel`             spatial
[Beyeler2019]_    `ScoreboardModel`          spatial
================  =========================  ===================

.. note::

    Spatial and temporal models can be mix-and-matched to create new models.
    See `Creating your own model <topics-models-building-your-own>`.

Basic usage
-----------

All models follow the same basic work flow:

*  **Initialize** the model with the desired model parameters.
*  **Build** the model to perform one-time heavy computations such as building
   the axon map in :py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.AxonMapModel`.
*  **Predict a percept** by passing an implant that contains a stimulus. The
   model will return a :py:class:`~pulse2percept.percepts.Percept` object that
   acts as a data container with labeled axes.

Here is how to run the :py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.ScoreboardModel`:

.. ipython:: python

    # Initialize the model:
    from pulse2percept.models import ScoreboardModel
    model = ScoreboardModel(rho=200)

    # Build the model:
    model.build()

    # Predict the percept resulting from stimulating Electrode
    # A8 in Argus II with 30 uA:
    from pulse2percept.implants import ArgusII
    percept = model.predict_percept(ArgusII(stim={'A8': 30}))

Building your own model
-----------------------

To build your own model, you can mix and match spatial and temporal models at
will.

For example, to create a model that combines the scoreboard model
described in [Beyeler2019]_ with the temporal model cascade described in
[Nanduri2012]_, use the following:

.. code-block:: python

    # Instantiate:
    model = Model(spatial=ScoreboardSpatial(),
                  temporal=Nanduri2012Temporal())

    # Build:
    model.build()
    # etc.

To create a more advanced model, you will need to subclass the appropriate base
class. For example, to create a new spatial model, you will need to subclass
:py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.SpatialModel` and provide implementations for
the following methods:

*  ``dva2ret``: a means to convert from degrees of visual angle (dva) to
   retinal coordinates (microns).
*  ``ret2dva``: a means to convert from retinal coordinates to dva.
*  ``_predict_spatial``: a method that accepts an
   :py:class:`~pulse2percept.implants.ElectrodeArray` as well as a
   :py:class:`~pulse2percept.stimuli.Stimulus` and computes the brightness at
   all spatial coordinates of ``self.grid``, returned as a 2D NumPy array
   (space x time).

In addition, you can customize the following methods:

*  ``__init__``: the constructor can be used to define additional parameters
   (note that you cannot add parameters on-the-fly)
*  ``get_default_params``: all settable model parameters must be listed by
   this method
*  ``_build`` (optional): a way to add one-time computations to the build
   process

A full working example:

.. code-block:: python

    class MySpatialModel(SpatialModel):
        def __init__(self, **params):
            """Constructor"""
            # Make sure to call the parent's (SpatialModel's constructor):
            super(MySpatialModel, self).__init__(self, **params)
            # You can set additional parameters here (e.g., stuff you will
            # need later on in ``_build``). You will not be able to add
            # parameters outside the constructor or ``get_default_params``.
            self.n_fib = 100

        def get_default_params(self):
            """Return a dictionary of settable model parameters"""
            # Get all parameters already set by the parent (SpatialModel):
            params = super(MySpatialModel, self).get_default_params()
            # Add our own:
            params.update(myparam=1)
            # Return the combined dictionary:
            return params

        def dva2ret(self, dva):
            """Convert degrees of visual angle (dva) into retinal coords (um)"""
            return 280.0 * dva

        def ret2dva(self, ret):
            """Convert retinal corods (um) to degrees of visual angle (dva)"""
            return ret / 280.0

        def _build(self):
            """Perform heavy computations during the build process"""
            # Perform some expensive computation using parameters you
            # initialized in the constructor:
            self.heavy = some_heavy_comp(self.n_fib)

        def _predict_spatial(self, earray, stim):
            """Calculate the spatial response at different time points"""
            resp = np.zeros(self.grid.size, stim.time.size)
            for idx_t, t in enumerate(stim.time):
                for idx_xy, (x, y) in enumerate(self.grid):
                    # Response at (x,y,t) is the sum of x,y coordinates and
                    # all the stimuli at time t (an arbitrary, silly choice):
                    resp[idx_xy, idx_t] = x + y + np.sum(stim[:, t])
            return resp

Similarly, a new temporal model needs to subclass from
:py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.TemporalModel` and provide a
:py:meth:`~pulse2percept.models.TemporalModel._predict_temporal` method:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyTemporalModel(TemporalModel):
        def _predict_temporal(self, stim, t_percept):
            """Calculates the temporal response at different time points"""
            # Response at (x,y,t) is the stimulus at (x,y,t). Use stim's smart
            # indexing to do automatic interpolation:
            return stim[:, t_percept]

Stand-alone models vs. spatial/temporal model components
--------------------------------------------------------

In general, you will want to work with :py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.Model`
objects, which provide all the necessary glue between a spatial and/or a 
temporal model component. Objects are named accordingly:

*  An object named **\*Model** is based on
   :py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.Model`
*  An object named **\*Spatial** is based on
   :py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.SpatialModel`
*  An object named **\*Temporal** is based on 
   :py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.TemporalModel`

However, nobody stops you from instantiating a spatial or temporal model
directly:

.. code-block:: python

    # Option 1 (preferred): Work with Model objects:
    from pulse2percept.models import Model, Nanduri2012Temporal
    model = Model(temporal=Nanduri2012Temporal())
    model.build()
    model.predict_percept(implant)

    # Option 2: Work directly with a temporal model:
    model = Nanduri2012Temporal()
    model.build()
    model.predict_percept(implant.stim)

The differences between the two are subtle:

*  As you can see from the example above, a temporal model will expect a
   :py:class:`~pulse2percept.stimuli.Stimulus` object in its
   :py:meth:`~pulse2percept.models.TemporalModel.predict_percept` method
   (because it has no notion of space).
   It will return a 2-D NumPy array (space x time).

*  In contrast, the stand-alone model will expect a
   :py:class:`~pulse2percept.implants.ProsthesisSystem` object (which provides
   a notion of space and itself contains a
   :py:class:`~pulse2percept.stimuli.Stimulus`), and will return a
   :py:class:`~pulse2percept.percepts.Percept` object.

Getting and setting parameters
------------------------------

A :py:class:`~pulse2percept.models.Model` will hide the complexity that some
parameters exist only in the spatial or temporal model component.

Consider the following model:

.. ipython:: python

    from pulse2percept.models import (Model, ScoreboardSpatial,
                                      Nanduri2012Temporal)
    model = Model(spatial=ScoreboardSpatial(),
                  temporal=Nanduri2012Temporal())

    # Set `rho` param of the scoreboard model (works even though it's really
    # `model.spatial.rho`):
    model.rho = 123
    
    # Print the simulation time step of the Nanduri model (works even though
    # it's really `model.temporal.dt`):
    print(model.dt)

Although ``rho`` exists only in the scoreboard model, and ``dt`` exists only
in the temporal model, you can get and set them as if they were part of the
main model.

.. warning::

    If a parameter exists in both spatial and temporal models (e.g.,
    ``thresh_percept``), then calling ``model.thresh_percept = 0`` will update
    both the spatial and temporal model.

    Alternatively, use ``model.spatial.thresh_percept = 0`` or
    ``model.temporal.thresh_percept = 0``.
