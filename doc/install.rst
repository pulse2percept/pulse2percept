Installation
============

Because pulse2percept is in active development, there are at least two versions
to choose from:

-  ``stable``: Our :ref:`stable release <install-release>` can be installed via
   pip (see `docs <https://pulse2percept.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_,
   `code <https://github.com/pulse2percept/pulse2percept/tree/stable>`_).
-  ``latest``: Our bleeding-edge version must be installed 
   :ref:`from source <install-source>`, and may contain experimental features
   (see `docs <https://pulse2percept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
   `code <https://github.com/pulse2percept/pulse2percept/tree/master>`_).

.. note::

    Having trouble with the installation?
    Please refer to our :ref:`Troubleshooting Guide <install-troubleshooting>`.

.. _install-python:

Installing Python
=================

Before getting started, you will need to install Python on your computer.
You can check if Python is already installed by typing ``python --version`` in
a terminal or command prompt.

If you don't have Python, you have several options:

- If you're unsure where to start, check out the `Python Wiki`_.
- `Python Anaconda`_ (good but slow in 2020): comes with the conda package
  manager and a range of scientific software pre-installed (NumPy, SciPy,
  Matplotlib, etc.).
- `Python Miniconda`_ (fast but minimal): comes with the conda package manager
  but nothing else.

.. important::

    pulse2percept 0.4.3 was the last release to support Python 2.7 and 3.4.
    pulse2percept 0.5+ requires **Python 3.5+**.

On some platforms (e.g., macOS), you might also have to install pip yourself.
You can check if pip is installed on your system by typing ``pip --version``
in a terminal or command prompt.

If you don't have pip, do the following:

-  Download `get-pip.py`_ to your computer.
-  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing
   ``get-pip.py``.
-  Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python get-pip.py

.. _install-release:

Installing the stable pulse2percept release
===========================================

After :ref:`installing Python <install-python>` above, the stable pulse2percept
release can be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install pulse2percept

You can also install a specific version:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install pulse2percept==0.5.2

Then from any Python console or script, try:

.. code-block:: python

    import pulse2percept as p2p

.. important::

    Make sure you are reading the right version of the documentation:
    https://pulse2percept.readthedocs.io/en/stable
    (<-- "stable", not "latest").

.. note::

    Find out what's new in the :ref:`Release Notes <users-release-notes>`.

.. _install-source:

Installing version |version| from source
========================================

.. _install-source-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

1.  **Python** (>= 3.5): Make sure to :ref:`install Python <install-python>`
    first.

2.  **XCode**: On macOS, make sure to install `Apple XCode`_.

3.  **Cython** (>= 0.28): pulse2percept relies on C extension modules for code
    acceleration. These require a C compiler, which on Unix platforms is
    already installed (``gcc``). However, on Windows you will have to install a
    compiler yourself:

    1.  Install **Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019** from the
        `Microsoft website`_.
        Note that the build tools for Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 should work as
        well (Python >= 3.5 requires C++ 14.X to be exact).
        Also note that you don't need to install Visual Studio itself.

    2.  `Install Cython`_:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip3 install Cython

        If you get an error saying ``unable to find vcvarsall.bat``, then there
        is a problem with your Build Tools installation, in which case you
        should follow `this guide`_.

    .. warning::

        Some guides on the web tell you to install MinGW instead of Visual Studio.
        However, this is not recommended for 64-bit platforms.
        When in doubt, follow `this guide`_.

4.  **Git**: On Unix, you can install git from the `command line`_. On Windows,
    make sure to download `Git for Windows`_.

5.  **make** (optional): pulse2percept provides a Makefile to simplify the
    build process.
    ``make`` is part of `build-essentials`_ on Ubuntu, `XCode`_ on Mac OS X,
    and can be downloaded from `ezwinports`_ on Windows.

6.  **OpenMP** (optional): OpenMP is used to parallelize code written in Cython
    or C. OpenMP is part of the GCC compiler on Unix, and part of the
    `MinGW compiler <https://stackoverflow.com/a/38389181>`_ on Windows.
    Follow `these instructions 
    <https://dipy.org/documentation/1.0.0./installation/#openmp-with-osx>`_ 
    to get it to work on macOS.

Dependencies
------------

.. include:: ../README.rst
   :start-line: 103
   :end-line: 155

Obtaining the latest code from GitHub
-------------------------------------

1.  Go to `pulse2percept on GitHub`_ and click on "Fork" in the top-right
    corner (you will need a `GitHub account`_ for this).
    This will allow you to work on your own copy of the code
    (``https://github.com/<username>/pulse2percept``)
    and contribute changes later on.

2.  Clone the repository to get a local copy on your computer:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/<username>/pulse2percept.git
        cd pulse2percept

    Make sure to replace ``<username>`` above with your actual GitHub user
    name.

    .. note::

        A "fork" is basically a "remote copy" of a GitHub repository; i.e.,
        creating "https://github.com/<username>/pulse2percept.git" from
        "https://github.com/pulse2percept/pulse2percept.git".

        A "clone" is basically a "local copy" of your GitHub repository; i.e.,
        creating a local "pulse2percept" directory (including all the git
        machinery and history) from
        "https://github.com/<username>/pulse2percept.git".

3.  Install all dependencies listed in ``requirements.txt``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    This includes Cython. If you are on Windows, you will also need a suitable
    C compiler (see :ref:`Prerequisites <install-source-prerequisites>` above).

    If you plan on :ref:`contributing to pulse2percept <dev-contributing>`,
    you should also install all developer dependencies listed in
    ``requirements-dev.txt``:

    .. code-block:: bash

       pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt

.. _pulse2percept on GitHub: https://github.com/pulse2percept/pulse2percept
.. _GitHub account: https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account

Building pulse2percept
----------------------

Assuming you are still in the root directory of the git clone, type
(note the ``.``):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install -e .

Then from any Python console or script, try:

.. code-block:: python

    import pulse2percept as p2p

.. important::

    Make sure you are reading the right version of the documentation:
    https://pulse2percept.readthedocs.io/en/latest
    (<-- "latest", not "stable").

Building with make
------------------

pulse2percept provides a Makefile to simplify the build process.
If you followed the :ref:`above guide <install-source-prerequisites>` to
install ``make``, the following commands are available:

*  ``make``: Installs pulse2percept
*  ``make uninstall``: Uninstalls pulse2percept
*  ``make tests``: Installs pulse2percept and runs the test suite
*  ``make doc``: Installs pulse2percept and generates the documentation
*  ``make clean``: Cleans out all build files
*  ``make help``: Prints a help message with this menu of options

.. _install-upgrade:

Upgrading pulse2percept
=======================

If you have previously installed pulse2percept, but wish to upgrade to the
newest release, you have two options.

To upgrade to the newest stable release, use the ``-U`` option with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install -U pulse2percept

To upgrade to the bleedingest-edge version, navigate to the directory where you
cloned the git repository. If you have never upgraded your code before, add
a new `remote repository`_ named "upstream" (you need to do this only once):

.. code-block:: bash

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/pulse2percept/pulse2percept.git

Then you `sync your fork`_ by grabbing the latest code from the pulse2percept
master branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull upstream master

.. _remote repository: https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork
.. _sync your fork: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

.. _install-uninstall:

Uninstalling pulse2percept
==========================

You can uninstall pulse2percept using pip:

.. code-block:: python

   pip3 uninstall pulse2percept

This works for both stable and latest releases.

In addition, if you installed :ref:`from source <install-source>`, you may want
to manually delete the directory where you cloned the git repository that
contains all the source code.

.. _install-troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
===============

Python ImportError: No module named pulse2percept
-------------------------------------------------

This is usually an issue related to ``$PATH``, the environment variable that
keeps track of all locations where pip should be looking for pulse2percept.
Chances are that pip installed pulse2percept somewhere outside of ``$PATH``.

You can check the installation location:

.. code-block:: python

   pip3 show pulse2percept

Then add the specificed location to ``$PATH``; see `PATH on Windows`_, 
`PATH on macOS`_, `PATH on Linux`_.

.. _PATH on Windows: https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/
.. _PATH on macOS: https://www.architectryan.com/2012/10/02/add-to-the-path-on-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/
.. _PATH on Linux: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/

Error in fast_retina.pyx when installing with pip on Windows
------------------------------------------------------------

Early builds of pulse2percept 0.4 mistakingly omitted the Windows binary
for the Cython-dependent ``fast_retina`` module (see :issue:`88`).
The solution is to either pip install :ref:`a later version <install-release>`,
or to :ref:`build from source <install-source>`.

.. note::

   Still having trouble? Please `open an issue`_ on GitHub and describe your
   problem there. Make sure to mention your platform and whether you are
   installing using pip or from source.
