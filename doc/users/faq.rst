Theoretical
===========

How are retinal coordinates mapped to visual field coordinates?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Studies often assume a linear mapping between retinal and visual field
coordinates (e.g., [Hayes2003]_, [Thompson2003]_).
A more exact transformation is given in [Watson2014]_, which corresponding code
in the :py:mod:`~pulse2percept.models.watson2014` submodule.
In any case, note that stimulation of the inferior (superior) retina leads to
phosphenes appearing in the upper (lower) visual field.
This is why visualization functions such as
:py:meth:`~pulse2percept.viz.plot_fundus` provide an option to flip the image
upside down.

Practical
=========

Why Python?
-----------

Python is free, well-designed, painless to read, and easy to use.
True, sometimes Python can be slow, but that is why we use `Cython`_ under the
hood, which takes execution up to C speed.

The code I downloaded does not match the documentation. What gives?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you are reading the right version of the documentation:

*  If you installed pulse2percept :ref:`with pip <install-release>`, you are
   using the stable release, for which you can find documentation at
   `pulse2percept.readthedocs.io/en/stable`_.

*  If you installed pulse2percept from source, you are using the
   :ref:`bleeding-edge version <install-source>`, for which you can find
   documentation at `pulse2percept.readthedocs.io/en/latest`_.

*  Unfortunately, pulse2percept < 0.5 is incompatible with ReadTheDocs.
   Please refer to the :ref:`Installation Guide <install-upgrade>` for
   information on how to upgrade your code to the latest version.
