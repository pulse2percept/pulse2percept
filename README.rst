pulse2percept: A Python-based simulation framework for bionic vision
====================================================================

Retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration
result in profound visual impairment in more than 10 million people worldwide, and a variety
of sight restoration technologies are being developed to target these diseases.

Retinal prostheses, now implanted in over 500 patients worldwide, electrically
stimulate surviving cells in order to evoke neuronal responses that are
interpreted by the brain as visual percepts ('phosphenes').
However, interactions between the device electronics and the retinal
neurophysiology result in perceptual distortions that may severely limit the
quality of the generated visual experience:

Built on the NumPy and SciPy stacks, `pulse2percept`_ provides an open-source
implementation of a number of computational models for state-of-the-art
`visual prostheses`_ (also known as the 'bionic eye'),
such as `ArgusII`_, `BVA24`_, and `PRIMA`_, to provide insight into the
visual experience provided by these devices.

.. _BVA24: https://bionicvis.com/products-technology
.. _PRIMA: https://www.pixium-vision.com/prima-bionic-vision-system

Simulations such as the above are likely to be critical for providing realistic
estimates of prosthetic vision, thus providing regulatory bodies with guidance
into  what sort of visual tests are appropriate for evaluating prosthetic
performance, and improving current and future technology.

Installation
============

Once you have Python 3 and pip, the `stable release`_ of pulse2percept
can be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install pulse2percept

The `bleeding-edge version`_ of pulse2percept can be installed via:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install git+https://github.com/pulse2percept/pulse2percept

.. _stable release: https://pulse2percept.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html
.. _bleeding-edge version: https://pulse2percept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

When installing the bleeding-edge version on Windows, note that you will have
to install your own C compiler first.
Detailed instructions for different platforms can be found in our
`Installation Guide`_.
