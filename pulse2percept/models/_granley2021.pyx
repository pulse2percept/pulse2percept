    Predicts representative percept using entire time interval, 
    and returns this percept repeated at each time point
    Parameters
    ----------
    amp_el : 1D float array 
        Amplitudes (as a factor of threshold) per electrode
    bright_model_el, size_model_el, streak_model_el : 1D float array
        Factors by which to scale brightness, rho (size), and lambda (streak length)
    xel, yel : 1D float32 array
        An array of x or y coordinates for each electrode (microns)
    axon_segments : 2D float32 array
        All axon segments concatenated into an Nx3 array.
        Each row has the x/y coordinate of a segment along with its
        contribution to a given pixel.
        ``idx_start`` and ``idx_end`` are used to slice the ``axon`` array.
        For example, the axon belonging to the i-th pixel has segments
        axon[idx_start[i]:idx_end[i]].
        This arrangement is necessary in order to access ``axon`` in parallel.
    idx_start, idx_end : 1D uint32 array
        Start and stop indices of the i-th axon.
    rho : float32
        The rho parameter of the axon map model: exponential decay constant
        (microns) away from the axon.
        Note that lambda was already taken into account when calculating the
        axon contribution (stored/passed in ``axon``).
    thresh_percept : float32
        Spatial responses smaller than ``thresh_percept`` will be set to zero
    n_threads: uint32
        Number of CPU threads to use during parallelization using OpenMP.

    Return Value
    -----------------
    Array with shape (n_points) representing the brightest frame of the percept
