    Parameters
    ----------
    stim : 2D float32 array
        A ``Stimulus.data`` container that contains spatial locations as rows
        and time points as columns. This is the output of the spatial model.
        The time points are specified in ``t_stim``.
    t_stim : 1D float32 array
        The time points for ``stim`` above.
    dt : float32
        Sampling time step (ms)
    tau1: float32
        Time decay constant for the fast leaky integrater (ms).
    tau2: float32
        Time decay constant for the charge accumulation (ms).
    tau3: float32
        Time decay constant for the slow leaky integrator (ms).
    eps: float32
        Scaling factor applied to charge accumulation.
    beta: float32
        Power nonlinearity (exponent of the half-wave rectification).
    thresh_percept : float32
        Spatial responses smaller than ``thresh_percept`` will be set to zero
