# Pulse to percept

Models for retinal prosthetics

## Project charter

### Objectives

By 2020 roughly 200 million people will suffer from retinal diseases such as
macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. Consequently, a variety of retinal
sight restoration procedures are being developed to target these diseases.
Electronic prostheses (currently being implanted in patients) directly stimulate
remaining retinal cells using electrical current, analogous to a cochlear
implant. Optogenetic prostheses (soon to be implanted in human) use optogenetic
proteins to make remaining retinal cells responsive to light, then use light
diodes (natural illumination is inadequate) implanted in the eye to stimulate
these light sensitive cells.

All these technologies require a coding method to translate the visual input
into a light or electrical stimulation protocol. Our goal is to develop an
optimized stimulation protocol that can be tested on the Second Sight Medical
Products Argus 2 prosthetic. Our hope is that eventually this will provide an
improved stimulation protocol for these and other devices (both electronic and
optogenetics).

### Current practice

Current devices essentially use a linear coding scheme that maps image luminance
directly to stimulation amplitude/rate. However such linear codes have been
shown to be deeply inadequate.

What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful? Our plan
is to develop and test a neurophysiologically inspired algorithm for improved
stimulation protocols in patients implanted with the 2nd Sight electronic
prosthesis. Our algorithm is novel in that will rely on  an existing
quantitative and validated model (developed by Project Leads Fine and Boynton)
of the perceptual effects of retinal stimulation. The current model can predict
the patients percept generated by any pattern of electrical stimulation. We will
'reverse-engineer' this model so we are capable of estimating the optimized
pulse pattern that will generate the ‘best possible’ visual percept.

### Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?

Any improvement in the perceptual outcomes of these devices will be of huge
importance, given that current perceptual outcomes in patients implanted with
prosthetics are surprisingly poor. The company 2nd sight and other companies are
extremely interested in the outcome.

### What are the risks and the payoffs?

Might not work

### How much will it cost? How long will it take?

There are no costs besides time, since one goal is to build a model that can be
built using relatively cheap hardware. See midterm and final exams for timeline

 Ideally an inverse model could be derived by simply inverting the transfer
 function (input-output function) of each part of the model. However, the
 transfer function of some boxes will not be easily inverted because they
 non-linearly depend on the entire history of the signals passed through them.
 For these parts of the model we will try two distinct approaches. The first is
 to model these blocks as dynamical systems that have 'state' (e.g., the
 integral of the current passed through them) and derive or approximate the
 model inverse using these states. The second approach would be to employ
 machine learning to learn the desired input-output relationship for each box,
 which has the advantage of deferring most of the computational load to the
 training phase, allowing for rapid classification/regression in the testing
 phase. In order  to create the amount of training data needed to achieve good
 generalization performance we will use the existing forward model of the
 perceptual effects of electrical stimulation over time to generate fake
 patients', and use these 'fake' responses to derive a loss function for the
 machine learning algorithm.

# What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?

- Specs for the model Jan 21st

- Forward model implementation: Feb 7. This will integrate existing code and set up the conceptual model in a format that will be suitable for reverse engineering. Thus this stage will set up a very well defined mathematical problem.

- Low-resolution  inverse model : March 1

- March 17th documentation and software testing complete
